<h2>Write a php file that searches for all the image files on the server and prints their paths to the screen. It should have a textbox and submit button at the bottom. When the user selects an image and pastes its path into the textbox and hits the submit button, the image is displayed. (Hint: hereâ€™s a windows command that finds all jpeg files: dir *.jpg /b/s).</h2>

<?php
echo "Hello World!";
