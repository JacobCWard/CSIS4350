1. Whatâ€™s the largest amount of text you can place by default in a textarea and have it printed by the server?
    - **textarea *maxlength* attribute:** The maximum number of characters (Unicode code points) that the user can enter. If it is not specified, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. *From: [MDN &lt;textarea&gt; Reference][mdn-ref]*
2. Write the [html and php][09-02] that has a listbox with 5 choices and tells you which ones you selected. ([plaintext][plain02])
