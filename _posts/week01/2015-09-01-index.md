1. Set up your portable xampp server (Friends of Apache or SourceForge) on your flash drive. Verify the sever runs by navigating to localhost in a browser.  Check the “status” link.  What is running and what is not?  Verify php is running by checking the phpinfo link.  Put up and test a “Hello World” web page.

    - ![Hello World page](../images/week01/01-helloWorld.png "Hello World Page")

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

3. Find out how to get a list of all commands entered in a given session in the Chrome console.
    - Open DevTools in a separate window.
    - Open a DevTools window for the previously opened DevTools (using the [keyboard shortcut](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/shortcuts#opening-devtools). `cmd` + `option` + `I` on Mac. `F12` or `ctrl` + `shift` + `I` on Windows.)
    - Select the 'Resources' tab.
    - Select 'Local Storage' from the left panel.
    - View the value for the key `consoleHistory`.
