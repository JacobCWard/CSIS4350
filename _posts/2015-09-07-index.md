1. In your webpage from week 6 ex. 3, add an example of using the ajax command “load” using a non-trivial resource.
2. Create an interesting processing.js animation. (You can start with one of the one’s on the processing site).  
<script src="../scripts/Processing.js/processing.min.js"></script>
<small>Most of the code for this is from the example referenced in <a href="../scripts/processing-mouse-tracking.pde">processing-mouse-tracking.pde</a></small>
<canvas data-processing-sources="../scripts/processing-mouse-tracking.pde"></canvas>
3. Use Raphael to draw an interesting sine curve.  
<script src="../scripts/raphael-min.js"></script>
<script src="../scripts/07-03.js"></script>
<small><a href="../scripts/07-03.js">../scripts/07-03.js</a></small>  
<canvas id="sine-canvas" width="400px" height="200px" style="background-color: #222222"></canvas>
4. Create an interesting SVG animation using Raphael.
