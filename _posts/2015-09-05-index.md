1. Using JavaScript, numerically integrate the sine function between 0 and Pi and print the result in a web page.
2. To the picture page we wrote today, add appropriate text boxes and labels which allow the client to enter the position of the upper left hand corner of the picture. Add an event handler that moves the picture to the appropriate position.
3. Using the w3schools events page as a reference, create a web page that illustrates these events: ondblclick, onmouseover, onkeypress, onselect as well as these methods: screenX and screenY.
4. Create a short demo that illustrates the difference between the display and visibility properties of css, using the Saturn image we used in class.
