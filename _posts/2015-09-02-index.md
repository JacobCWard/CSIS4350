    - [ex 4.8: no_zeros()][ex4-8]
    - [ex 4.11: counter()][ex4-11]
    - [ex 4.12: tst_name()][ex4-12]
    - [ex 4.13: row_averages()][ex4-13]
2. Write a function that [computes the cube of x][02-02]. [Generate the cubes of 1 through 20][02-02] (using our range function) and one of the vectorized methods.
3. Write a function called “[capitalizeAll][02-03]” that takes a string and capitalizes it.
    - {% highlight js linenos %}
var i=1;
{% endhighlight %}
