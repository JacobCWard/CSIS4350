1. Write a php file that runs an executable from 3150. I recommend using the squares program.
2. Write a php file that searches for all the image files on the server and prints their paths to the screen. It should have a textbox and submit button at the bottom. When the user selects an image and pastes its path into the textbox and hits the submit button, the image is displayed. (Hint: here’s a windows command that finds all jpeg files: dir \*.jpg /b/s).
3. Illustrate these php commands:
    - date
    - require
    - readfile
    - fopen
    - fread
    - fgets
    - fwrite
4. Using php, what’s the biggest text file you can upload and have printed by the server?
    - By default, the largest file size that can be uploaded is 2MB. This can be changed to another value by editing the `upload_max_filesize` php.ini directive on the server. *From php.net '[Description of core php.ini directives][php-defaults]'*
5. Google “10 Example JSON files” from SitePoint. Write the HTML and AJAX to read the “Google Maps” JSON file from the server and display the information it contains in a nice way.
6. Take a few web pages you have already created and have them run in a nodejs server.
